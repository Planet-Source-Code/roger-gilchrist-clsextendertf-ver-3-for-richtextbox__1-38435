### Description

ClsExtendedRTF.Cls version 3 for RichTextBox

extensive rewrite, recode and rename.

Mostly about manipulating RTF code to change text and background colours.

Now includes API and RTF based higlighting(Not selection, this is the RichTextBox

equivalant of highlihter pens).

Highlighting with:

API advantage it can detect highlighting; disadvantage single colour at a time

RTF advantage multicolour highlighting. disadvantage can't detect itself.

ClsAPIZoom for RichTtextBox, a few lines of code and your RTBox is zoomable.

cLsManifestation (incorperated from my other upload) Gives compiled program user's choice

of Classic or WindowsXP(if they have XP)

added panels(form) which give you greater control over

highlight, text colour and text format.

*New* Materials interface you can create your own materials colour schemes.

*New* Styles; if you create a text and background colour scheme you want to reuse

save it with a name and access through the RTF Font Painter tool and class.

fixed small bug in RemoveFormatting which added a space to start;(if selection was at start of doc)

see earlier versions for mor details.
